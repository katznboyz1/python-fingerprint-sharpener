# Fingerprint Sharpener

## This program sharpens fingerprints by increasing the contrast to achieve visible prints.
***Instructions:***

*1.] Get an image of a fingerprint, this should be a clean print on a relatively blank background, like a white piece of paper, and the powder used should be dark colored. If you cant see the outline of the print with your eyes, chances are the program wont pick it up. This program doesnt make invisible prints visible, it just makes visible prints easier to see.*

*2.] Run the program using the correct command line arguments. The argument "--grayscale-color-threshold" is a value from 0 to 255. If the color in the image is higher than the value, then it sets the color to white. If it is lower than the value, then it sets it to black. This is how the program achieves its level of contrast.*

## Keep in mind that you may need to combine multiple output images to create a good result image.

*This after image consists of a combination of two images generated by the program, one where the value was set to 65, for the dark spots and then another where it was set to 85, for the lighter spots.*
